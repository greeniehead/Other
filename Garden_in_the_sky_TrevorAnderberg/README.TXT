Our project is a top-down hack and slash arena game. We decided to cut 
out a lot of story-based and needlessly complicated content in favor of 
functionality, ending up with a level-based arena game, where you 
advance by defeating a set number of enemies. These enemies will chase 
after you if you come within a certain range and will otherwise will 
move randomly around. You can pick up swords, shields and potions to 
increase your player's stats as you go through the world. The story 
based design had to be scrapped because of the time consuming nature of 
building maps in the scrolling world code. The code requires you to hard 
code in every object instead of placing with the mouse and clicking save 
world. Creating a story based map in this way would of take far too long 
so it had to be scrapped.
